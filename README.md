## Website migration 2022

This repo was used to discuss the 2022 migration of the TDWG website (<https://www.tdwg.org>) to Jekyll. This has now been implemented (https://github.com/tdwg/website/pull/479).

This repo is archived so that [discussions](https://github.com/tdwg/website-migration-2022/issues) remain accessible. The repo has been renamed from `website-jekyll` to `website-migration-2022`, but links will redirect automatically.
